# Wat Classroom

## Problem
Different people study best in different places. For some, it may be the comfort of the apartment, for others it might be the silence of the libraries. But for me and my friends, it is the empty classrooms. It is not too difficult to get a classroom, but in exam season, classrooms always seem full. 

Is there a way to ensure that we always get an empty class? We must decide **WAT CLASSROOM**?. 

## Solution
Presenting to you WatClassroom, an app where user inputs the required date and time, gets nearest empty classrooms which classrooms just got empty or are about to get empty. 
Can filter out the unnecessary buildings.
